# BaseWars-Development
BaseWars for Garry's Mod

This will predominantly cover the gamemode code development but will also cover addons and other areas of the server.

If there are any issues with the gamemode, feel free to report them over in the issues tab. Once I approve, I will add it to the Kanban board to be later worked on.

I recommend using Zenhub to view the issues in a Kanban layout.
